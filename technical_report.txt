Phase 1: Group 8 Techinical Report

- Motivation
    - The motivation behind our project, SeniorUplift, stems from the growing need for easily accessible welfare 
    resources for the elderly population in Texas. As healthcare needs increase with age, it is crucial to ensure 
    that seniors can quickly locate nearby healthcare centers and nursing homes to receive proper care. Moreover, 
    promoting mental health and well-being by providing information about local entertainment and social activities 
    helps seniors maintain an active and enjoyable lifestyle. By integrating these resources into a user-friendly 
    platform, we aim to uplift the quality of life for the elderly, ensuring they have easy access to the support 
    and services they need in their community.
